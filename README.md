##As part of my Java programming task, I developed a file handling utility designed to perform a range of operations such as reading from files, writing to files, updating file content, and deleting files. The main objective of the task was to demonstrate practical understanding of file I/O (Input/Output) operations in Java and how to use various classes from the java.io and java.nio.file packages to build a utility that can automate common file manipulation tasks. The utility is capable of working with both text and binary files, and it supports interactive file management through a command-line interface.##
